EVEREST
-------

Pixel Level Decorrelation of K2 Light curves


To-do
=====

- Run a quick version of the pipeline, no optimization!
- Cite `this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07442>`_ on asteroseismology
- Test **EVEREST** on short-cadence data
- Better saturation and crowding metrics
- Interpolate over each module with basis vectors from bright stars (paper 2)
- Compute gain curve to correct saturated pixels
- Lighter blue line in precision figure (11)
