The Catalog
===========

The **EVEREST** catalog is available `here <https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/everest/>`_
and includes ``.fits`` files with the de-trended light curve data as well as ``.jpg`` figures
associated with each EPIC target. Follow the links below for detailed information about the catalog.

.. note:: It is **highly recommended** that users access the catalog through the \
          :py:mod:`everest.usertools` module, as this allows for post-processing of \
          the light curves with custom masks. For more information, check out the \
          `Running Everest <running_everest.html>`_ section.
