The Catalog
===========

The **EVEREST** catalog is available `here <https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/everest/>`_
and includes ``.fits`` files with the de-trended light curve data as well as ``.pdf``
data validation summaries associated with each EPIC target. Follow the links 
below for detailed information about the catalog.

.. note:: It is **highly recommended** that users access the catalog through the \
          :doc:`everest interface <user>`, as this allows for post-processing of \
          the light curves with custom masks.
