  <b>EVEREST</b> (EPIC Variability Extraction and Removal for Exoplanet Science Targets)
  is an open-source pipeline for removing instrumental noise
  from light curves generated by <i>K2</i>, the repurposed <a href = "http://kepler.nasa.gov/">Kepler</a> spacecraft.
  Operating with only two of four reaction wheels, <i>K2</i> is unable to maintain the precise
  pointing precision required to detect the small light modulations caused by transiting
  exoplanets. <b>EVEREST</b> exploits correlations across the pixels on the <i>Kepler</i> CCD to
  remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft's pointing error, yielding light curves
  with precision comparable to that of the original <i>Kepler</i> mission. Here we provide
  detailed documentation of the <b>EVEREST</b> pipeline, which was coded in Python and is
  freely available on <a href = "https://github.com/rodluger/everest">github</a>.
