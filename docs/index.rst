**EVEREST** (EPIC Variability Extraction and Removal for Exoplanet Science Targets)
is an open-source pipeline for removing instrumental noise
from light curves generated by `K2`, the repurposed `Kepler <http://kepler.nasa.gov/>`_ spacecraft.
Operating with only two of four reaction wheels, `K2` is unable to maintain the precise
pointing precision required to detect the small light modulations caused by transiting
exoplanets. **EVEREST** exploits correlations across the pixels on the `Kepler` CCD to
remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft's pointing error, yielding light curves
with precision comparable to that of the original `Kepler` mission. Here we provide
detailed documentation of the **EVEREST** pipeline, which was coded in Python and is
freely available on `github <https://github.com/rodluger/everest>`_.
