The Paper
=========

Below we provide links to Python scripts to generate all the figures in the
`paper <https://github.com/rodluger/everest/blob/master/paper/tex/k2.pdf>`_.
Most allow the user to generate the figures from scratch, but some load in `.npz`
files with pre-downloaded and pre-de-trended data. It shouldn't be *too* hard to
generate that data yourself, though...
