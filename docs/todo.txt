The To-Do List
==============


.. todo::

  - Take median of unsaturated background!
  - Plot the autocorrelation function and scatter in the binned residuals 
    as a function of bin size.  Of course stellar variability that remains 
    unmodeled can cause this scatter, but it will be interesting to compare 
    with the other pipelines.
  - Test **EVEREST** on short-cadence data
  - Compute gain curve to correct saturated pixels
  - Interpolate over each module with basis vectors from bright stars (paper 2)
