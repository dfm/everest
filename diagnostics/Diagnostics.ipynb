    "Looks like the more neighbors you add, the better you do at the faint end but the worse you do at the bright end. I imagine that this is because adding more stars reduces the amplitude of the regularization parameter, so you end up decreasing the weight of the star's own pixel vectors. For faint stars that's OK, since there's not that much information in them, but for bright stars you end up losing de-trending power. The plot below is the **estats** output comparing a run with 10 neighbors and a run with 50 neighbors. It is clear that 10 neighbors is the way to go.\n",

Ignore the saturated stars, since I wasn't yet implementing column collapse -- stars brighter than mag 11 are definitely being overfit (issue resolved now!).

    "The downside of nPLD is that the PLD model must be run beforehand, so you're running `everest` twice for each star. We can instead run the model just once -- I call this *simple* nPLD. The difference is that when PLD is run beforehand, we know where the outliers are for each of the neighboring stars, so we mask them when using their pixels as regressors. With *simple* nPLD, the outliers (thruster fires, deep transits, etc.) are present in the regressors. But as it turns out, it makes no difference! In fact, I find slightly **better** de-trending with *simple* nPLD, as shown below.\n",

This involves using a guess for the covariance matrix, since I don't want to waste time optimizing the GP. As it turns out, this leads to slightly *worse* de-trending than regular nPLD, so we're not going to do this.\n",
