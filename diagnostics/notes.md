NOTES:

- Look at distribution of lambdas
- 212286667: Saturated 7 mag star, de-trends really well! Compare to K2SC.
- 212290017: Saturated 9 mag star, same thing.
- PLD: 2743 targets took 16 hours on 15 * 16 cores. 
  That's 3840 CPU hours, or 1.4 CPU hours per target.
  The 155k stars in C0-8 will take 220k CPU hours, or
  40 days on the 16 core nodes. Double that to do nPLD
  on all of them.
