# EPIC XXXXXXXXX
# ==============
#
# DESCRIPTION
# -----------
# De-trended light curve generated by the Everest 2.0 pipeline.
# Everest implements third order pixel-level decorrelation to
# remove instrumental systematics from light curves. Here
# we provide a simple version of the de-trended timeseries, but
# users are encouraged to interface with the Everest catalog
# using the Python code available at
# 
# https://github.com/rodluger/everest 
#
# This is particularly useful for users interested in transit
# photometry. Like any regression method that attempts to 
# minimize photometric scatter, Everest may partially overfit
# transit features that are not properly masked. The Everest
# code provides easy-to-use methods to mask known transits,
# eliminating biases in the transit depth. For more information,
# consult the documentation:

# COLUMN INFO
# -----------
# TIME (float): Time (BJD - 2454833)
# CADN (int):   Cadence number
# FCOR (float): CBV-corrected, PLD de-trended flux
# FLUX (float): PLD de-trended flux
# FRAW (float): Raw simple aperture photometry flux
# MASK (int):   0 = Data point was included in the model calculation
#               1 = Data point was NaN in the raw flux
